English Surnames

In the student sample program files for this chapter, you will find a text file named surnames.txt. The file contains 14,674 English surnames. Each line in the file has one surname. Write a program that reads the names from the file into a List. The program should let the user perform the following searches:

Find all the names that are longer than a specified length.

Find all the names that are shorter than a specified length.

Find all the names that begin with a specified string of characters. (For example, find all the names that begin with “All”.)

Determine whether a specified name exists in the List.
